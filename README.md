A simple JWT token based REST API sample with a single table User where username and password are required to get access to method other than authenticate, SignUp and while creating a role. For furhter detail please visit https://dotnetbyseleena.blogspot.com/p/page.html

I built this following the article in https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2019/10/14/aspnet-core-3-simple-api-for-authentication-registration-and-user-management. 
I have also found a good article explaining why JWT [Json Web Tokens] is highly adapted these days in the response at stackoverflow. The link is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure#:~:text=The%20contents%20in%20a%20json,feature%20for%20verifying%20token%20authenticity.&text=The%20asymmetric%20nature%20of%20public,by%20its%20matching%20private%20key.
